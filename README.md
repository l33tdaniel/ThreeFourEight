##### *Included in this README is a brief description and help guide which is elaborated in our incldued documents.*

## USE Guide
### Step 1: Open the Software by Compiling and Running a C++ Program  

    Open your preferred C++ compiler, IDE, or terminal. 
    
    Navigate to the repository with the software. 
    
    Locate a C++ source file, for example, ‘main.cpp’. 
    
    The ‘main.cpp’ file houses all the code.  
    
    Compile and run the program.  
    
    Use command-line tools like ‘g++’ to compile.    
    
    g++ main.cpp -o calculator. 

 

### Step 2: Input an Expression 
    
    Look for an input area or command line where you can enter your arithmetic expression. 
    
    Type in the expression you want to evaluate. For example, you can enter something like ‘2 + 3 * (5 - 1)’. 

### Step 3: Understand Operator Precedence   

    Be aware of the order of operations (operator precedence). Our software follows the rule ordering: brackets as highest priority, division, multiplication, and modulus (from left to right) as second priority, and addition and subtraction (from left to right) as last priority. 
    
    In the example ‘2 + 3 * (5 - 1)’, the expression inside the brackets is evaluated first, then the multiplication, and finally, the addition. 

### Step 4: Use Parentheses for Clarity 
    
    If your expression involves complex operations, use parentheses to explicitly define the order of evaluation. For example, ‘(2 + 3) * (5 - 1)’ ensures that the addition inside the first set of parentheses is done before the multiplication. 

### Step 5: Utilize Arithmetic Operators  

    Use standard arithmetic operators for basic operations: 
    
    ‘+’ for addition. 
    
    ‘-’ for subtraction. 
    
    ‘*’ for multiplication. 
    
    ‘/’ for division. 
    
    ‘%’ for modulus. 
    
    ‘(‘ and ‘)’ for order of operations. 

###  Step 6: Review and Execute 
    Double-check your expression for correctness. 
    
    Execute the calculation, by hitting “enter”. 
### Step 7: Interpret the Results 
    After entering the expression, the software should display the result of the calculation. 

### Step 8: Handle Errors 

    If there are errors in your expression, the software may provide error messages. Carefully review these messages to identify and correct any mistakes.
